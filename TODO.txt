TODO 
- Add thread to bell, front-heatsink-case, bell cover 
- Add threads underneath where 
- Add holes to front heatsink cover 
- Add brackets to tube between bell and front heatsink
	- A braket can be placed inside the front heatsink, if we split it down the mirror plane.
	- Splitting the front heatsink in two would also allow us to fit the laser driver inside. 
		- It would be best to split 
- Add spacers to front-heasink case so that the heatsink stays in place. 
	- If we hollow out the heatsink, a bracket can be added in there
	- through hole threads could also be added, and be hidden by the hexagon-like geometry on the heatsink front cover


- CAD the slots for the small tubing on the bell 

- Make box cover look prettier 
- Model the handle 
- Model the small tubing 
- Create reference list
- Create BOM



- should the bell cover be completely flat on the front side to allow for threads to be easily printed? 

- Make assembly instructions so that you can confirm you can easily fit everything together
